# Animations

In AquaticCrates there are 3 different types of general animations.
Those are:
- [Open Animations](#open-animations)
- [Fail Animations](#fail-animations)
- [Idle Animations](#open-animations)

Using those animations you can completely modify overall crate behavior to your likings!

## Open Animations
Using open animations you setup how's overall opening phase going to look like.

## Fail Animations
Fail animations are being used when a player does not meet certain conditions, like not having a key, having full inventory, etc.

## Idle Animations
Idle animations are simply for idling, when you want to spice up crate sorroundings.
